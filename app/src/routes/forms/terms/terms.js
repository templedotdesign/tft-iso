          It is also the traveler’s responsibility to contact their cell phone provider and determine if their 
          plan allows for use outside the US and if so what additional fees apply.  It is important to note 
          that if you continue to use your cell/data package while outside the US without adding an 
          international plan, you may incur huge charges for phone and data plan usage outside the US.

          permission for the t child to travel outside the United States and provide emergency medical care if 
          necessary.  This would apply to grandparents, only one parent traveling, divorced parent traveling.

          prior to travel. Tons of Fun Travel accepts no responsibility for air schedule changes, delays or

          is the sole responsibility of the traveler to confirm with the airline in advance of travel to

          time. Tons of Fun Travel will advise clients of baggage fees that are current at the time of booking. 
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'red'}}>INSURANCE</p>
        <p>
          Tons of Fun Travel is licensed by the State of Ohio for travel insurance sales and has provided you 
          detailed information and the opportunity to purchase travel insurance. Many insurance companies require 
          the policy to be purchased and written within a certain timeframe in order to cover things such as 
          pre-existing medical conditions and supplier default. Tons of Fun Travel has informed you of this 
          deadline, and highly recommends the purchase of travel insurance to protect your vacation investment. 
          If charges for travel insurance are not listed on your booking statement, you have not paid for 
          insurance within the required timeframe or an insurance policy number is not noted on your final 
          invoice, you have elected to DECLINE Travel Insurance even if you initially checked “accept” on your 
          original invoice. Insurance claim approval is determined by the travel insurance company, and Tons of 
          Fun Travel accepts absolutely no responsibility for any denied claims.
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'red'}}>SPECIAL REQUESTS</p>
        <p>
          Special Requests, (i.e. room views, location, bedding preference, adjoining rooms, seat requests, etc.) 
          cannot be guaranteed by the travel agency/tour operator/airline. While every attempt will be made to 
          accommodate such special requests, the travel agency/tour operator/airline will not be held 
          responsible if such requests cannot be fulfilled.   Airline seat requests also cannot be guaranteed 
          even if we note preferences.  If a schedule change occurs, it is possible to be moved to a different 
          flight and existing seat assignments may no longer be honored.  The travel agency does not have 
          control over the airline nor their seating policies.
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'red'}}>PAYMENTS</p>
        <p>
          Payments by credit or debit card are preferred, and by authorizing charges to your card you expressly 
          waive the right to chargebacks as a means to mediate disputes. Please note that checks are accepted for 
          final payments (within 3 weeks of final payment date) but not for initial deposits or airline only 
          tickets. These must be made by credit or debit card only. Bounced checks are subject to a $25 returned 
          check fee, and future payments by check will no longer be accepted.   If a credit card is declined, 
          agent will attempt to contact client to remedy the situation.   It is important to note that the 
          package price may increase while the details are trying to be corrected in the matter of a credit 
          card decline.  CLIENTS SHOULD NOTE THAT EVENTHOUGH THEY HAVE PAID FOR A VACATION PACKAGE OR SEGMENTS 
          IN ADVANCE, HOTELIERS, AIRLINES, RENTAL CAR COMPANIES AND OTHER VENDORS WILL ASK FOR A CREDIT CARD 
          TO BE USED DURING TRAVEL FOR INCIDENTAL CHARGES, BAGGAGES FEES, RENTAL CAR GUARANTEE, ETC. NEVER 
          TRAVEL WITHOUT A CREDIT CARD WHICH CAN BE USED FOR THESE PURPOSES! IF YOU ARE USING A DEBIT CARD FOR 
          DURING TRAVEL CHARGES, YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT POSSIBLE HOLDS CAN BE PLACED ON YOUR ACCOUNT FOR 
          SEVERAL DAYS AND THAT MIGHT AFFECT YOUR SPENDING CASH.  Always check with your bank to see if your 
          card incurs foreign transaction fees if you plan to travel outside the US.
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'red'}}>CANCELLATIONS, CHANGES AND REFUNDS</p>
        <p>
          Once payment is applied to a booking, cancellation/change penalties will apply. Cancellation policy 
          vary from supplier to supplier. Cancellation requests MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING prior to your 
          departure date, and you must receive a written reply from us confirming cancellation has been made. 
          No refund is made for unused travel services or any portion thereof, nor is the price or value of unused 
          travel services exchangeable for alternative arrangements. Changes to the current booking are subject to 
          the terms and conditions of the tour operator/airline and may result in penalties or change fees. The 
          purchase of travel insurance to cover your vacation investment is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for unexpected 
          circumstances that neither the travel agent nor the client can control. It is to be noted that if you 
          do not add travel insurance, your entire trip investment may be at risk.  It is also important to note 
          that your personal US medical coverage may not cover you outside the US and each travelers should 
          consult their benefits department for full disclosure of those details.
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'red'}}>AIRPORT CHECK IN AND FLIGHT RECONFIRMATION</p>
        <p>
          All passengers should arrive at the airport at least 2 (or 3 for international) hours prior to flight 
          departure, view documents for definite recommendation. Charter flights may have different requirements 
          than commercial flights. Tons of Fun Travel will make every attempt to assign seats in advance, 
          however if we are unable to assign seats on your flight for any reason, seats will be assigned upon 
          check-in at the airport and are on a first come, first served basis. While seat assignments are made 
          by the airline, we are unable to guarantee that clients will be seated with their traveling companions. 
          For security reasons, all passengers must be present identification for check-in. You will not be 
          allowed to board, nor will you be entitled to a refund, if you have not checked in by the required 
          time. Please ensure you contact your airline at least 24 hours prior to departure and on the day of 
          departure, as it is your responsibility to reconfirm all your flight details before departure. A 
          customer’s failure to contact the airline in regards to reconfirming the airline times and details 
          may result in a flight being missed. Tons of Fun Travel does not accept legal responsibility or 
          liability if any customer misses a flight due to a failure to reconfirm flight times as advised, or 
          to other circumstances beyond our control. If our agency is aware of any schedule changes in advance 
          of your departure, every effort will be made to advise you directly. Clients should understand that 
          being a no show for a flight, may result in the other leg of your flight being cancelled by the 
          airline without notice. ALL airlines charge baggage fees and you should visit the airline website to 
          determine what charges are applicable to your flight and destination. Some seats assignments also 
          have a service fee associated and all seats booked may not be upgradeable. Again, client has 
          responsibility to visit airlines website or contact customer service with said airline to determine 
          exact parameters as applicable to your ticket.

        <p style={{color: 'red'}}>HONEYMOONERS & ANNIVERSARY TRAVELERS</p>

          complimentary honeymoon/anniversary packages offered by the resort. A photo copy is recommended. 
          Failure to have such proof of marriage may result in the resort denying these complimentary privileges 
          (if applicable). Please notify your Tons of Fun Travel agent if you are celebrating a Honeymoon or
