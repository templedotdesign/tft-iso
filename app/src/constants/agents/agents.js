      'After 30 years doing payroll and benefits for our local school district, I retired at age 51 and started my travel agency, Tons of Fun Travel. Our love of travel, became a way of life for the last 11 years, that we have had our agency. 3 years ago, Robert retired from Honda of America, and while he had been working with me part-time for the first 8 years, he then became a full-time agent as well as handling officer manager duties.',

    title: 'Why Book With Us?',
    content: [
      'We can book anything from a one night hotel stay to a complex trip of Europe, Honeymoons and Destination Weddings, all inclusive resorts, Disney Trips, and everything in between.  Whatever it is you are looking for, we can point you in the right direction.  We put in hours of research to find you the perfect getaway.',
      "The great thing about using our travel agency is that we do not charge fees. We are paid a commission by our suppliers. If you choose not to use a travel agent, those funds are retained by the supplier and not passed along to the consumer. So, by using a travel agent, you are able to secure the best pricing along with great customer service, without any additional fees. We don't charge any type of a retainer either, we simply ask that if we find something that meets your criteria that you do indeed book the trip through us versus booking it yourself.  That is the only way we are paid for our time and research, is if the trip is actually booked thru our agency.",
      'Our alliance is to our clients, not to a particular brand.  We are always looking out for our clients.  We have done property visitations to many of the destinations/resorts that we sell and we know the scoop on which ones you should visit and more importantly which ones you shouldn’t.',
      'We would love to work with you.  Give us a try!'

      'My husband and I had never been on a vacation for just the two of us, so in the beginning stages of planning a 5 year anniversary getaway, we had no idea where to begin in the planning process. I had heard of Tons Of Fun through many of my facebook friends, so I decided to shoot them a message. By that evening, Stephanie had not only gotten back to me, but we had narrowed down our destination, AND she had sent me an email with 3 or 4 room options, excursion options, and flight options. It took 100% of the stress of worry from us. She had excursions, VIP packages for when we arrived at the airport, and different room packages for us to choose from. It not only gave us price options, but it also gave us options I would not have even thought of considering during our trip. It was such a wonderful experience working with her from the first message I had sent, to the week of our trip when our travel plans arrived in our mailbox. The travel guide completely walked us through our trip, and details down to what we needed to do to get through customs. What an amazing time we had, and what a relaxing stress free trip that she had planned for us. We will be booking through Tons Of Fun for all of our future travel needs! – Allison H 9/17',

      'I’m the owner to Tons of Fun Travel.  I first began thinking about a career in travel when assisting our high school choir group in planning a trip to New York City when I was the Choral Booster President when my sons were in high school, in the late 1990s.',
      'My fulltime career, at that time, was Payroll/Benefits Administrator for our local school district.   As I approached retirement, I gave more thought to my second career, as I would only be 51 years old upon completing my 30 years with the school district.',
      'About 18 months before retirement, I started working as a part time travel agent, and found it was something I really enjoyed and seemed to fit well with my skill set.  So, in February 2009, I launched my 2nd career as a full time travel agent, and I haven’t looked back.',
      'I have truly enjoyed this 2nd career, meeting a lot of new people, traveling with groups, planning trips that make people happy is truly rewarding! 2018 is my 11th year working in travel and it has been “quite a ride”.   My favorite type of travel to plan is Honeymoons and Destination Weddings.',
      'In addition to owning the travel agency, I’m a fun loving Wife, Mom of 2 sons, and Grandma to 2 beautiful grandchildren.  I love to travel, read, dance, and paint.  I love doing volunteer work in our community, this year I will embark on a new adventure serving as a board member of the Hardin Chamber and Business Alliance.  I am past president of our local United Way, and served an 8 year term on their board.',

      "We loved working with Stephanie to plan our anniversary trip. From meeting to look at locations and resorts, to picking one and planning the trip, traveling and having her there every step of the way was amazing! Stephanie is so easy to work with and had everything organized and taken care of. It allowed us to have peace of mind even in the hustle and bustle of flying. We won't travel any other way now. Thanks Stephanie and Tons of Fun Travel for helping us have the time of our lives! – Kendra 12/17",
      "This was our first trip to Disney together that wasn't a school band trip and it was awesome! Stephanie and Tons of Fun Travel did a great job setting everything up for us. – Robin 11/17",
      'Stephanie is amazing and did a great job helping me with everything! Such an awesome experience!! Will definitely use them again!! – Heather 11/17',
      "We appreciated everything Stephanie did to help our family out!! We'll definitely be using her for our future vacations!! – Brittany 9/17",
      'Our experience with Tons of Fun Travel and working with Stephanie was easy and stress free. We booked a Southern Caribbean cruise with early arrival in San Juan for our honeymoon. The only thing that was not planned was hurricane Irma, but Stephanie went the extra mile to check on us to ensure we were safe and communicated with me to ensure there were no issues with return flights. We were very fortunate not to experience any bad weather due to the hurricane and no canceled flights, that a lot of people had to deal with. However, know that if we ran into any problems Stephanie was there to assist was very comforting. We will definitely be using Tons of Fun Travel in the future! – Traci 9/17',
      'Stephanie worked and got what I wanted and it was a perfect fit! Loved our location. – Tina 8/17',
      'Stephanie was our travel representative and was very easy to work with she responded at most times immediately to our emails. I will definitely book again with Stephanie as she makes the process very easy and takes care of everything – Lana 7/17',
      'Loved working with Stephanie - very informative and helpful. – Christine 6/17',
      'We had an excellent experience with Tons of Fun Travel. Reaching out initially with 2 potential locations in mind, Stephanie provided top 3 options for both locations by looking at price, location, time of year, interests, etc to determine what our best options would be . She provided great insight in a timely manner, and saved us hours upon hours of research we would have had to to do.  Along with the upfront research, Stephanie provided a travel document highlighting what was included, travel arrangements once we arrived to our foreign country, and pointers on what is acceptable/not acceptable in the given area. She also was huge help in checking us into our flights, and sending our boarding passes so we could completely "shut down" for the week!  Great Experience, thank you Stephanie! – Megan 1/17',
      'I had the vacation of a lifetime! Everything was wonderful, just what I was hoping for. Travel was easy, resort was amazing, and I had spectacular view of the Las Vegas strip!!!! Stephanie made it easy and fun! I will definitely be back to book my next vacation. Thank you for a wonderful trip! – Toni 12/16',
      "Stephanie went above and beyond to make sure any question or concern we had was addressed. She also provided us a nice mix of options to consider when deciding where to vacation. All in all, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. – Ryan 12/16",
      'We will be working with Stephanie again on future vacations. She was excellent and extremely responsive to messages and emails. – Matt 6/16',
      'We are repeat customers of Stephanie. We truly appreciate all that she has done to help our family take one of our best vacations ever! She was very quick to help find out prices, give us Hotel ideas and set up a payment plan. She took all of the stress and hard work out of the planning so we could focus on having fun. We will definitely be returning for her help in the future. – Diana 6/16'

      'Hi there.  My name is Bob.  I am the husband of Stephanie, the owner of this agency.  When she first mentioned that she wanted to become a home-based travel agent, I thought to myself, “that will be a nice little hobby for you, to keep yourself busy”.  Well, that keeping herself busy has now become the thing for both of us.  She asked me to help her, because she was SO busy.  Then I became busy with it too.  So much, that my career employer made it possible for me to retire also.  Now we are both full time agents.',
      'I also enjoy bicycle riding, traveling (obviously), and I recently started taking music lessons, to learn to play an instrument.  My music teacher is in for a tough road with me, as I have no musical experience prior to this.',

      'A big thanks to Tons of Fun Travel and especially Bob! We just got back from our Alaskan trip, which was both land & cruise. Bob got us started on this trip about 18 months ago and helped every step of the way including airfare which I thought I could get cheaper. The trip was set up perfectly (starting in Fairbanks and ending up in Vancouver) and we got to see so much. If you are reading this, you need to start talking to Bob about getting it set up. It is such an amazing place to see and one you will never forget. – John 7/17',

      'Nobody else has that red Global strap for their luggage and others asked how we got ours. Thanks--it really was noticeable! Also, thanks for letting us borrow your electrical converter box for the European outlets. – Ellen & Don 6/17',
      "We enjoy using Tons of Fun Travel. Bob always gets back to us promptly, gives us a range of options within our budget and has great ideas for things we can't easily find on our usual travel websites, like Expedia or Travelocity. Our most recent trip to Cancun was at the El Dorado Seaside Suites. We plan to return someday and will definitely use Tons of Fun to book again. 5 stars! – Dacy 3/17",
      'We just got back from a trip to Hawaii and Disneyland. Tons of Fun Travel set up every thing. We had the time of our life and will be having Tons of Fun Travel arranging another trip for us soon. From the time we got off the plane in Hawaii till the time we came back to Columbus. everything was planned for us. Thank you Bob & Steph for a great time. – Charlie 5/17',
      'This was our first time using Tons of Fun Travel and our only regret was not having done so earlier! Bob took care of everything for us and even contacted the resort ahead of time knowing they had some construction projects going on and had our room located to a much more enjoyable location. We were very appreciative of this since some other couples were not so fortunate. We are already looking forward to booking our next trip with Tons of Fun Travel! – Krane 10/16',
      'Top of the line service! Everything was taken care of for us so that we could truly enjoy our trip. Tons Of Fun Travel was always available for any questions we had. I would highly recommend them! – Lori 10/16',

      'LOVE LOVE LOVE! Had excellent care and service from beginning to end of our Honeymoon! Thanks Bob! – Kimberly 7/16',
      'Love Tons of Fun Travel! Headache free for hubby and I. They do all the work (and I tell you they put in the work!). Our first trip was to Las Vegas and hubby was a little nervous about it but Stephanie put his fears to rest with her number for 24/7 if we needed her. That changed everything and we have been traveling ever since! We have gone on a couple group trips with them and made new friends and reacquainted with old friends. Lots of good times and great memories made. Getting ready for our next adventure and so excited. So if you ever want to start checking off that bucket list Bob & Stephanie are the ones to call. – Wanda 10/16',
      "I can't say enough good things about the company. I have travelled to Hawaii, Italy, quick trip to Fiesta Bowl O -H-, And in 9 days will be going to ALASKA. BELIEVE ME, we could've never gone on these trips without Tons of Fun Travel. If someone would ask me what makes them stand out from other travel agencies, I'd say, they never make me feel like I am being judged for not being a knowledgeable traveler or not knowing something, they either advise me or they take care of it for me. They are the best. – Deborah 7/16"

The Club Mobay representative was assigned exclusively to us and we were fast tracked through immigrations and on to the VIP Lounge to relax & enjoy complimentary drinks while waiting on our transfer to the resort. The resort was wonderful and the only major decision we were left with each day was whether to swim in one of the pools or spend the day at the beach! This is a vacation that we never would have experienced if Mike and Laura hadn’t arranged it and we can’t wait for them to book our next adventure! Ron & Shari/2017'

So after much thought about what I wanted to do in my “second” job when I retired, I decided to become a travel agent in June 2009.  This was my dream job.  I initially thought the best part of the job would be that I myself, could feed my need for travel, visiting all kinds of destinations abroad.',
      'But as my business grew, the reality of my job was that I was helping others to make their travel dreams come true, and that has actually been more fulfilling than I ever could have imagined.  I love seeing the pictures that my clients share with me when they have returned from their honeymoon, or the excitement in their voices when they tell me about the amazing castles they saw on their trip to Scotland and England. Or the Fjords and waterfalls of Norway.  And best is when they thank me for making these trips become a reality for them and tell me what that meant to them. All of these reactions have been more of a blessing in my life than I ever could have imagined.',
      'My husband and I recently celebrated our 40th anniversary with a beautiful trip to the Island of Grenada, along with 4 other couples.  We stayed at the beautiful Sandals La Source resort, and it was an amazing experience.  I have also recently been able to mark a few destinations off of my bucket list…Norway and Ireland. My true passion is my family and friends, but ranking right up there a VERY close second is my love of all things travel related.'
